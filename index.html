            What is HTML?

        </h2>
        <p>
            <b>Hypertext Markup Language <u>(HTML)</u> </b> is the standard markup language for
            creating web pages and web applications.
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render
            them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically
            and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and
            other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML
            provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text
            such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements
            are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <r>&#60img/></r>
            and <r>&#60input></r>r directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as
            <r>&#60p></r>
            and <r>&#60/p></r> surround and provide information about document text and may
            include sub-element tags.
            Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the
            content of the page.HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as
            JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
            content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look
            and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of
            the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of
            CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5,
            is used to display video and audio, primarily using the <r>&#60canvas></r> element,
            together with JavaScript.

            Markup
        </h2>

        <p>
            At its core, HTML is a series of short codes typed into a text-file.
            These are the tags that power HTML’s capabilities.
            The text is saved as an HTML file and viewed through a web browser.
            The browser reads the file and translates the text into a visible form,
            as directed by the codes the author used to write what becomes the visible rendering.
            Writing HTML requires tags to be used correctly to create the author’s vision.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tags are what separate normal text from HTML code.
            Tags are the words between what are known as angle-brackets, which allow graphics, images,
            and tables to appear on the webpage. Different tags perform different functions.
            The most basic tags apply formatting to text. As web interfaces need to become more dynamic,
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript applications may be used. CSS makes web pages
            more accessible and JavaScript adds power to basic HTML.
